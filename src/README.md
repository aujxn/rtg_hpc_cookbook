# Introduction

This is a simple guide to getting set up using NGsolve on the
Coeus (see-us) High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

The [OIT RC website](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/research-computing/home)
has lots of usefull information as well, some of which is repeated in this guide.

- [Git Reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [NGSolve Docs](https://docu.ngsolve.org/latest/)
- [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

The Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced chapters contain general tips and
procedures for working remotely on Linux servers. All of the topics covered
are only briefly mentioned and are not meant to be complete guides, but act
as a starting point for doing more in depth research.

The NGSolve chapter has specific instructions for getting setup and running
the example codes.
